# H2O Util
 
H2O Util is a Python library that simplifies the use of H2O, an open-source distributed machine learning platform. H2O Util provides a number of features that make it easier to use H2O, including:
- Prediction with pandas DataFrames: H2O Util makes it easy to predict on pandas DataFrames. With H2O Util, you can simply pass a pandas DataFrame to an H2O model and get predictions back.
- Scikit-learn integration: H2O Util can be used to wrap H2O models into scikit-learn pipelines. This makes it possible to use H2O models with other scikit-learn tools, such as cross-validation and grid search.
